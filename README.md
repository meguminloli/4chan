# 4chan

4chan is a simple application written in go that tries to download
all images from some 4chan board.
If you want to change the board, just change the `/g/` to `/a/` or
whatever. 
If the board is a red board, then don't forget to change 
`https://boards.4channel.org/` to `https://boards.4chan.org`.

It will download all the images in ~/4chan folder. Some images can be
corrupted.
